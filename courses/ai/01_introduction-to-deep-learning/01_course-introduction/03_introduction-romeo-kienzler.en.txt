Hi. My name is Romeo. I'm working as Data Scientist for IBM. And I'm an instructor in this course. My background is in Computer Science. So I have a Masters in Information Systems, Computational Statistics and Bioinformatics. I'm into Machine Learning since around 2011, and into Deep Learning since around 2014. Currently, I'm managing and supporting Data Science projects all around the globe. And I'm really hoping that you enjoy.
