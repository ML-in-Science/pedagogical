Hi, everyone. My name is Niketan Pansare, and I'm one of the core instructor of the schools. Just a little background, I did my PhD in computer science and from Rice University. And since then, I've been working at IBM Almaden Research Center. I've been primarily working on a project called SystemML which is now a top level Apache project. In the schools, I will introduce SystemML, and also, I'll be covering a module on denoise. Hope you enjoy this course.
