Hi. I'm John Cohn,

2
00:00:01,815 --> 00:00:06,575
IBM fellow and Chief Scientist for the Watson IoT data center here in Munich,

3
00:00:06,575 --> 00:00:09,660
and I want to welcome you to this wonderful start of

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,828
a class on Applied AI in Deep Learning,

5
00:00:12,828 --> 00:00:14,745
done by my friend Romeo here.

6
00:00:14,745 --> 00:00:16,395
You're going to love this class.

7
00:00:16,395 --> 00:00:17,730
I'm taking it too,

8
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:23,455
and as somebody who's been on the sidelines of AI since the very beginning,

9
00:00:23,455 --> 00:00:29,168
40 years ago, Marvin Minsky son was my roommate at MIT,

10
00:00:29,168 --> 00:00:31,115
and talking to Marvin about neural nets,

11
00:00:31,115 --> 00:00:33,420
I thought, "Yeah, like that's going to happen."

12
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:39,510
I went on to build devices like gaming processors that had GPUs.

13
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:43,140
Little did I know that at the other end of my 40 years that

14
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,145
I'd be using GPUs to help do real neural nets.

15
00:00:47,145 --> 00:00:50,160
You're going to find that this is a great way to get into this.

16
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,575
As somebody who started on punch cards, now,

17
00:00:52,575 --> 00:00:55,350
I'm using all the modern tools, TensorFlow,

18
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,245
Keras, Jupyter, and solving real problems.

19
00:00:58,245 --> 00:01:00,270
Here, in this beautiful building in Munich,

20
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:04,013
we take in thousands of data points all the time on the building,

21
00:01:04,013 --> 00:01:05,453
the air quality, the temperature,

22
00:01:05,453 --> 00:01:07,905
the humidity, people flow,

23
00:01:07,905 --> 00:01:10,050
control of the buildings, lights,

24
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:13,455
windows et cetera, and we are using Romeo's code,

25
00:01:13,455 --> 00:01:15,555
the stuff that you're going to learn in this class,

26
00:01:15,555 --> 00:01:18,000
to do deep learning and build

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,480
models that will help us determine what's normal and what's not normal.

28
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,835
We'll be able to do things like predicting

29
00:01:23,835 --> 00:01:27,250
occupancy so we can pre-cool or pre-warm the building.

30
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:30,641
We're making it so that we can do all these experiments

31
00:01:30,641 --> 00:01:34,200
using the infrastructure that you're going to learn in this excellent course.

32
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,869
So, thank you for checking in,

33
00:01:35,869 --> 00:01:39,155
enjoy the course, and thank Romeo for me.

34
00:01:39,155 --> 00:01:40,326
He's made it all very,

35
00:01:40,326 --> 00:01:41,540
very easy for all.
