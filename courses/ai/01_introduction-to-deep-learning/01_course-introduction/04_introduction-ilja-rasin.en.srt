00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,210
Hello. My name is Dinerason.

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:06,560
I'm a data scientist at IBM Watson Health.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,380
In this course, I have prepared for you

4
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:13,605
some very interesting sessions about sequence prediction

5
00:00:13,605 --> 00:00:20,449
with LSTM and neural network and Kerras framework.

6
00:00:20,449 --> 00:00:22,895
Let me introduce myself briefly.

7
00:00:22,895 --> 00:00:28,450
My professional career I have started as medical doctor,

8
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:33,160
something which is completely different to data science.

9
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:36,376
Then I went to Germany and studied at

10
00:00:36,376 --> 00:00:40,690
the University of Hamburg, Econometrics and Mathematics.

11
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:47,510
I was also lecturer for math for about five years at the University of Hamburg.

12
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:51,935
And since already five years,

13
00:00:51,935 --> 00:00:54,840
I'm with IBM in Switzerland in Zurich.

14
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,750
And I'm very excited to be with you in this course.

15
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:02,070
And hope you will have great time,

16
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,835
excitement, and a lot of fun with our sessions.

17
00:01:06,835 --> 00:01:09,090
So, see you in upcoming sessions.
