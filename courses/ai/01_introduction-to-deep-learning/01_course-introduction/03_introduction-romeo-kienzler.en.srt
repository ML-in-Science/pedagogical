Hi. My name is Romeo.

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,620
I'm working as Data Scientist for IBM.

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,110
And I'm an instructor in this course.

4
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:09,375
My background is in Computer Science.

5
00:00:09,375 --> 00:00:11,940
So I have a Masters in Information Systems,

6
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:16,280
Computational Statistics and Bioinformatics.

7
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,450
I'm into Machine Learning since around 2011,

8
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:23,030
and into Deep Learning since around 2014.

9
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:28,270
Currently, I'm managing and supporting Data Science projects all around the globe.
