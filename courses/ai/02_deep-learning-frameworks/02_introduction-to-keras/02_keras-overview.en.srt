1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:04,450
Okay, let's get started with
our introduction to Keras.

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,030
First off what is Keras,
and why would you use it?

3
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,190
Keras is a popular deep learning
framework written in Python.

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:14,620
It has been open sourced in 2015, and

5
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:20,080
it's excellent documentation
can be found on the keras.io.

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,825
In case you're interested,

7
00:00:21,825 --> 00:00:25,609
the source code can be found on
GitHub under the following link.

8
00:00:27,562 --> 00:00:30,740
Okay, why would you choose
Keras as your debugging tool?

9
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:34,800
There's quite a few aspects to it, and
one thing I want to mention is community.

10
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,890
Keras is a very popular library.

11
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:39,770
And as an active and

12
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:43,370
positive community that might help you
with any questions that you might have.

13
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:48,650
So for instance, you might direct your
questions towards the following Google

14
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:53,600
group or you join the following Slack
channel, and people could help you there.

15
00:00:55,990 --> 00:01:03,390
Alright, another crucial aspect that
makes Keras a strong pick is its design.

16
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:08,676
Keras has an intuitive high-level
API that makes it very easy for

17
00:01:08,676 --> 00:01:12,299
you to get started with first examples and
deep learning.

18
00:01:14,832 --> 00:01:19,748
With this intuitive API,
you can quickly prototype new models and

19
00:01:19,748 --> 00:01:23,710
have a very fast development and
prototyping cycle.

20
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:33,440
Also, Keras is built with very modular
building blocks and easy to extend.

21
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,686
So for instance,
if you want to build new custom layers,

22
00:01:37,686 --> 00:01:40,877
that's quite easy to achieve with Keras.

23
00:01:44,802 --> 00:01:48,590
Another thing that makes Keras
quite interesting is the ecosystem.

24
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:53,220
For instance, under the following
link you'll find many resources

25
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:57,140
on top of Keras,
that includes third party libraries,

26
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,800
as well as full-blown applications
built on top of Keras.

27
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:05,410
Also, Keras comes shipped with many end
to end examples that you can simply

28
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:06,140
check out and run.

29
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,950
On top of that,

30
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:13,850
in Keras you have many pre-built models
that have all ready been trained for you.

31
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:20,790
And there's quite a few data
sets available in Keras.

32
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:24,590
So that means,
you don't have to manually download many

33
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:28,320
of the standard data sets out there and
pre-process them.

34
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,480
But you can just load them
through the Keras API.

35
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,660
Another interesting aspect to
Keras is the concept of backends.

36
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:45,920
So one way to view Keras is, you can
see it as your deep learning front-end.

37
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,120
So essentially what Keras provides is

38
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,250
your high level entry point to
deep learning, but in the back,

39
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:58,470
what actually runs Keras is different
engines that do all the heavy lifting.

40
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,500
So there's a choice of
backends available for Keras.

41
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:09,160
First of all, there's Google Tensorflow,
which is also the default engine for

42
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:09,790
Keras.

43
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:15,090
And we will exclusively use
Tensorflow in this course.

44
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:19,207
Then there's theano, and
also Microsoft CNTK.

45
00:03:21,861 --> 00:03:27,412
You can quite easily swap backends and
depending on your configuration,

46
00:03:27,412 --> 00:03:30,376
Keras runs seamlessly on CPUs or GPUs.

47
00:03:32,834 --> 00:03:36,824
So before we introduce the concepts
of Keras in more detail,

48
00:03:36,824 --> 00:03:42,850
let's just have very first look,
a glimpse, at an example built with Keras.

49
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:47,902
First thing you do is,
you load the data set, in this case,

50
00:03:47,902 --> 00:03:52,210
the mnist data set 400 digits,
directly through the Keras API.

51
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:56,550
Then, you define a model,
in this case, a sequential model.

52
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:04,730
After we have done so, you can just add
new layers to your model one by one.

53
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:10,640
After that, we compile our
model with a loss function and

54
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,480
an optimizer and
fit our model on training data.

55
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:19,560
On a high level,
that's all there is to it.

56
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,780
Every Keras example, more or
less looks like this.

57
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,360
All right, to install Keras,

58
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,560
we first have to install a backend, as we
said before we're using Tensorflow here.

59
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,760
So go ahead and install Tensorflow
with pip install Tensorflow.

60
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,725
Optionally, we also need to
install other dependencies.

61
00:04:42,725 --> 00:04:49,284
[COUGH] For instance,
we need the library h5py for model.

62
00:04:49,284 --> 00:04:54,225
So go ahead and
install it through pip installer h5py.

63
00:04:55,979 --> 00:05:00,522
As last step, we need to install Keras
itself through pip installer keras.

64
00:05:00,522 --> 00:05:05,740
All right,
that was the first introduction to Keras.

65
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:10,520
In the next video, we introduce
the sequential model API of Keras.
