Hello, and
welcome to this part of the ghost.

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:07,010
My name is Max Pumperla and
I'm a Deep Learning Engineer at Skymind.

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:09,793
While my background is in pure
mathematics; I've been in data science and

4
00:00:09,793 --> 00:00:11,920
in particular,
deep learning for many years.

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,085
I'm currently working on open-source
machine learning software for

6
00:00:15,085 --> 00:00:17,456
the JBM such as the tensor library,
and for the 4J and

7
00:00:17,456 --> 00:00:20,370
the deep learning framework,
deep learning 4J.

8
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:23,040
Also for which you will learn
more about later in this series.

9
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:27,150
In this part of the course, I will
introduce you to a popular high level deep

10
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,720
running library written
in Python called Keras.

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,777
I've been working with and contributing
to Keras over the last few years and

12
00:00:33,777 --> 00:00:35,271
hope you would like it as much as I do.

13
00:00:35,271 --> 00:00:40,117
In the next few videos you will see
how to quickly prototype deep learning

14
00:00:40,117 --> 00:00:43,860
models using Keras elegant and
intuitive API, enjoy.
