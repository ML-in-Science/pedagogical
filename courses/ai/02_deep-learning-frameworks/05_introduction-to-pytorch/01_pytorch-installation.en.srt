00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,820
Welcome back. Today, we're starting our PyTorch introductory sessions.

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:07,815
What is PyTorch?

3
00:00:07,815 --> 00:00:15,620
PyTorch is a new Deep Learning Framework which is highly dynamic in tons of ways.

4
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:23,040
This framework is is a rising star on the sky of Deep Learning and very,

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,550
very popular especially by research.

6
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:28,980
But first of all,

7
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,050
we just going to download and install

8
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:37,370
PyTorch in our Watson Data Science Experience workbook.

9
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:45,505
Just go to pytorch.org then scroll down to the Get Started section and then here,

10
00:00:45,505 --> 00:00:48,145
you have a selection.

11
00:00:48,145 --> 00:00:55,260
For our Watson Data Science Experience notebooks,

12
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,210
we need operating system Linux,

13
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:00,909
we need package manager pip,

14
00:01:00,909 --> 00:01:06,205
and we select Python 2.7.

15
00:01:06,205 --> 00:01:12,990
And we don't select CUDA because,

16
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,116
at least at the moment,

17
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:19,365
we don't have GPU acceleration there.

18
00:01:19,365 --> 00:01:24,393
And then you have here this two lines of code.

19
00:01:24,393 --> 00:01:35,100
Just copy them and go to your Jupyter Notebook and then you can paste them,

20
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:45,640
but you have to place exclamation marks at the beginning of the line before pip.

21
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,620
And then you just execute this,

22
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:57,983
and I don't execute it because I have already installed PyTorch in my environment.

23
00:01:57,983 --> 00:01:59,190
And then you can test.

24
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,715
If you import PyTorch,

25
00:02:00,715 --> 00:02:05,317
you see everything went mostly, everything is fine.

26
00:02:05,317 --> 00:02:08,640
So, see you then in the next session.

27
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,560
Then, we are going to look at the important packages

28
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:20,450
of PyTorch and do some interesting things. Bye-bye.
