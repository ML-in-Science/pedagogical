congratulations on making it this far I just wanna wrap up and leave you with a few final thoughts we've been on quite a journey together but if you've taken the whole specialization then you've learned about new networks and deep learning how to improve deep neural networks of the structure machine learning projects convolutional neural networks and then in this most recent course sequence models and I know you work really hard and I also hope you feel very proud of yourself for your hard work and for how much you've done so I want to leave you one maybe important thought which is that I think deep learning is a superpower with deep learning algorithms you can make a computer see you can have a computer synthesize novel art or synthesized music or you can have a computer translate from one language to another maybe have it locally radiology image and render a medical diagnosis or build pieces of a car that can drive itself and if that isn't a superpower I don't know what is and as we wrap up this sequence of courses as we wrap up this specialization I hope that you will find ways to use these ideas to further your career to pursue your dreams but perhaps most important to do whatever you think is the best work you can do our humanity the world today has challenges but with the power of a on power of deep learning I think we can make it a much better place and now that you have this superpower I hope you will use it to go out there and make life better for yourself but also for other people and of course I also hope you feel very proud of your accomplishments in the power far you've come and of all that you've learned and when you complete this sequence of causes you should also share it on social media like Twitter or Facebook and let your friends know and finally the very last thing I want to say to you is congratulations on Nikolas I hope you feel great about your accomplishments but also I want to thank you very much I know that you have a busy life but despite that spends a lot of time watching these videos and maybe spent a long time also working on the quizzes and the programming exercises I hope you enjoyed it and you got a lot out of the process but I'm also very grateful for all your time you spend and for all your hard work you put into learning these materials so thank you very much
