00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,770
congratulations on making it this far

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,950
I just wanna wrap up and leave you with

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:09,599
a few final thoughts

4
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:11,880
we've been on quite a journey together

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,950
but if you've taken the whole

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,890
specialization then you've learned about

7
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,869
new networks and deep learning how to

8
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:20,789
improve deep neural networks of the

9
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:22,830
structure machine learning projects

10
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:25,019
convolutional neural networks and then

11
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:27,840
in this most recent course sequence

12
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:30,240
models and I know you work really hard

13
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,759
and I also hope you feel very proud of

14
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,309
yourself for your hard work and for how

15
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,390
much you've done so I want to leave you

16
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:38,640
one

17
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:42,750
maybe important thought which is that I

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,940
think deep learning is a superpower with

19
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:47,360
deep learning algorithms you can make a

20
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:50,670
computer see you can have a computer

21
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,829
synthesize novel art or synthesized

22
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,890
music or you can have a computer

23
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:58,020
translate from one language to another

24
00:00:54,890 --> 00:01:02,340
maybe have it locally radiology image

25
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:05,309
and render a medical diagnosis or build

26
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:08,040
pieces of a car that can drive itself

27
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:11,970
and if that isn't a superpower I don't

28
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:14,490
know what is and as we wrap up this

29
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:17,280
sequence of courses as we wrap up this

30
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:21,180
specialization I hope that you will find

31
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:24,360
ways to use these ideas to further your

32
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:26,909
career to pursue your dreams but perhaps

33
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,900
most important to do whatever you think

34
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:34,470
is the best work you can do our humanity

35
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:36,750
the world today has challenges but with

36
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:39,240
the power of a on power of deep learning

37
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,340
I think we can make it a much better

38
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:44,490
place and now that you have this

39
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:47,189
superpower I hope you will use it to go

40
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:50,180
out there and make life better for

41
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:52,920
yourself but also for other people and

42
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:55,439
of course I also hope you feel very

43
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,780
proud of your accomplishments in the

44
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,479
power far you've come and of all that

45
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:03,060
you've learned and when you complete

46
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,430
this sequence of causes you should also

47
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:08,509
share it on social media like Twitter or

48
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:10,800
Facebook and let your friends know and

49
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:13,319
finally the very last thing I want to

50
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,480
say to you is congratulations on

51
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:17,969
Nikolas I hope you feel great about your

52
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:20,670
accomplishments but also I want to thank

53
00:02:17,969 --> 00:02:23,400
you very much I know that you have a

54
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:25,889
busy life but despite that spends a lot

55
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,170
of time watching these videos and maybe

56
00:02:25,889 --> 00:02:30,840
spent a long time also working on the

57
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:33,060
quizzes and the programming exercises I

58
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,010
hope you enjoyed it and you got a lot

59
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,620
out of the process but I'm also very

60
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:39,629
grateful for all your time you spend and

61
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,510
for all your hard work you put into

62
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:45,019
learning these materials so thank you

63
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:45,019
very much
