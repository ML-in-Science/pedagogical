1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,505
So, let's have a look at the IBM Watson Natural Language Classifier.

2
00:00:03,505 --> 00:00:06,290
So, this is a natural language processing service.

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:10,290
It's just based on deep learning and comes as a service in the cloud,

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,145
and again it's just the ReST API,

5
00:00:13,145 --> 00:00:16,770
and we are seeing here a little demo user interface.

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,580
So, this is an already pre-trained classifier.

7
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:23,440
Of course, you can train the classifier on your own with your own data,

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,170
but this has been trained with weather-related data.

9
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:30,105
Let's ask a question,

10
00:00:30,105 --> 00:00:37,010
and you see here the classifier is 100% confident that we are talking about temperature.

11
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:38,565
So, I assume the question,

12
00:00:38,565 --> 00:00:40,070
"Should I prepare for sleet?"

13
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:43,640
will recite a condition, let's see.

14
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,655
Let's see here, you have 0.94% accuracy that we are talking about conditions.

15
00:00:48,655 --> 00:00:50,430
So, this is just a little example.

16
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,905
So, you can train this classifier in the cloud using ReST API,

17
00:00:53,905 --> 00:00:58,620
you don't care about the topology and parameterization of your neural network.

18
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,930
And it basically just works.

19
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:04,650
Okay? Let's see what we can do more, and
