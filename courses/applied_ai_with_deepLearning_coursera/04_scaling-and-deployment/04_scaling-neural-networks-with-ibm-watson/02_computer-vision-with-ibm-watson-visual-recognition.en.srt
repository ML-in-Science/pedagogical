1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,450
So, one example of new network

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:08,680
already deployed for you in the cloud is IBM Watson Visual Recognition.

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:12,113
So this is a computer vision API,

4
00:00:12,113 --> 00:00:15,705
and the cool thing here is you cannot only use it as it is,

5
00:00:15,705 --> 00:00:17,980
you can train it with your own data.

6
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:20,205
Now, let's have a look how it performs.

7
00:00:20,205 --> 00:00:25,040
So first of all, we take this example image here. This a Chihuahua.

8
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:30,890
You can see here, it's also recognized by the service.

9
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:37,280
Let's take another one. Okay. It's quite nice.

10
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,900
So that you know that I'm not cheating,

11
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:49,190
I am now using a photo of mine but let's actually create a new one.

12
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,970
So let's drag and drop this.

13
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:06,540
And you see here,

14
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,013
he got my age right and also my gender,

15
00:01:09,013 --> 00:01:13,730
and it's a portrait photo in front of my green screen.

16
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:19,135
So that's basically the way how to use the service for scoring.

17
00:01:19,135 --> 00:01:22,665
But now, we can train it with our own data.

18
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:29,535
And let's take some sample images which are already here,

19
00:01:29,535 --> 00:01:32,575
but you can also upload your own database

20
00:01:32,575 --> 00:01:36,545
or you can also use a REST API to interact with the service.

21
00:01:36,545 --> 00:01:38,820
So this is only just a demo application.

22
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,380
So let's select all categories.

23
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:49,789
So we have broken windshield and flat tire and motorcycle involved,

24
00:01:49,789 --> 00:01:53,100
vandalism and undamaged vehicles.

25
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,301
This will take some time.

26
00:01:56,301 --> 00:02:01,995
So now, training is finished and let's do the system test image to see how it performs.

27
00:02:01,995 --> 00:02:08,390
So you see here that's definitely vandalism and now let's take another one.

28
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:14,290
So, we are searching for broken tire.

29
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:19,530
So, maybe this one.

30
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:29,280
So, we take the link to the image and paste URL, hit enter.

31
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:36,580
You see here, it's a flat tire with 98% score. So, this is correct.

32
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:37,647
So as you can see here,

33
00:02:37,647 --> 00:02:40,500
this is now a complete service deployed in the cloud,

34
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,970
but you still can train it so you can use it as an ordinary convolution,

35
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:47,140
deep learning image classifier.

36
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:50,155
But you don't have to care about scalability,

37
00:02:50,155 --> 00:02:54,443
operations and also to parameterization of a new network you don't care about.

38
00:02:54,443 --> 00:02:56,110
So, that's pretty cool.

39
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,690
So, let's see what else...
