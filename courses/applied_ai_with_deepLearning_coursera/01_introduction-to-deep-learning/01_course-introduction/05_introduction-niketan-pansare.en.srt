Hi, everyone. My name is Niketan Pansare,

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:06,525
and I'm one of the core instructor of the schools.

3
00:00:06,525 --> 00:00:08,490
Just a little background,

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,030
I did my PhD in computer science and from Rice University.

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:16,435
And since then, I've been working at IBM Almaden Research Center.

6
00:00:16,435 --> 00:00:18,415
I've been primarily working on a project called

7
00:00:18,415 --> 00:00:22,425
SystemML which is now a top level Apache project.

8
00:00:22,425 --> 00:00:25,365
In the schools, I will introduce SystemML,

9
00:00:25,365 --> 00:00:28,955
and also, I'll be covering a module on denoise.

00:00:28,955 --> 00:00:30,270
Hope you enjoy this course.
