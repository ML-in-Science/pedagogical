Hi my name is Tom Hanlon.

2
00:00:01,975 --> 00:00:07,510
I will be delivering the sections of this course that cover Deep Learning 4J.

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:11,875
Sometimes shortened to DL 4J.

4
00:00:11,875 --> 00:00:13,700
And what DL 4J is,

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:17,960
is a tool kit for building neural networks using Java.

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,105
And although many data scientists work in Python,

7
00:00:21,105 --> 00:00:26,380
the most widely used language in enterprise application space is Java.

8
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:30,820
So DL 4J aims to build a toolkit to focus on Java,

9
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:36,214
but also to help bridge that gap between Python and Java,

10
00:00:36,214 --> 00:00:39,085
we provide a tool called Keras Model Import,

11
00:00:39,085 --> 00:00:43,665
and this allows the loading of models that have been built in Keras using Python,

12
00:00:43,665 --> 00:00:48,390
import them into DL 4J and deployed on the JVM,

13
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,400
in the Java environment.

14
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,358
In addition to the Keras Model Import,

15
00:00:53,358 --> 00:00:59,040
some other features of DL 4J that I will be covering in this course will be executing DL

16
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,546
4J neural networks for either training or inference

17
00:01:02,546 --> 00:01:06,690
where we just ask the neural net for its output on Sparke.

18
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:10,170
So in this courses I will be demonstrating Keras Model Import DL

19
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,000
4J execution on Sparke in

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,075
the IBM data science experience and also just

21
00:01:18,075 --> 00:01:23,110
executing locally in Java on the data science experience.

22
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:26,460
If you wanted to learn more about DL 4J,

23
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,525
you can visit deeplearning4J.org for documentation,

24
00:01:30,525 --> 00:01:34,320
examples and a quickstart guide that will help you set up

25
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,620
your java environment in intelliJ and IDE,

26
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:44,345
integrated developing environment to work with DL 4J directly.

27
00:01:44,345 --> 00:01:47,000
Enjoy the course. Nice meeting you.
