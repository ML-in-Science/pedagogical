1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,570
So, let's start with some Course Logistics.

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:04,335
So this is a four-weeks course.

3
00:00:04,335 --> 00:00:05,580
In the first week,

4
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,207
we started linear algebra and neural network theory.

5
00:00:09,207 --> 00:00:10,380
In the second week,

6
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,585
we introduced you to some neural network frameworks like TensorFlow,

7
00:00:14,585 --> 00:00:18,755
Keras, PyTorch, Deeplearning4j, system of it.

8
00:00:18,755 --> 00:00:20,595
And in the third week,

9
00:00:20,595 --> 00:00:22,865
we will show you some practical examples of

10
00:00:22,865 --> 00:00:25,880
deep learning in real-life industry use cases, for example,

11
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,625
an image classification, natural-language processing,

12
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:31,850
anomaly detection of sensor data,

13
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:34,995
or times use forecasting of stock market data.

14
00:00:34,995 --> 00:00:36,850
In the fourth week,

15
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:38,215
it's all about deployment.

16
00:00:38,215 --> 00:00:41,935
So in week four, we'll show you how you can scale and deploy

17
00:00:41,935 --> 00:00:47,500
your neural network on clusters of CPU and GPU machines and make it ready for production.

18
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:52,270
Each week has one created programming assignment and a couple of quizzes.

19
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:55,645
After you have completed all of requirement assignments and the quizzes,

20
00:00:55,645 --> 00:00:58,865
you will get a certification and the benchmark course.

21
00:00:58,865 --> 00:01:04,510
That is a specialization that means if you complete this course and some others,

22
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:09,970
you we get the certification that you are IBM Watson IoT Certified Data Scientist.

23
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,740
So I think this is pretty cool.

24
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,020
I hope that you are enjoying the course, and let's have
