00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,765
Welcome back. Today, we are going to

2
00:00:03,765 --> 00:00:10,915
discuss a very important topic which is the Batch-size.

3
00:00:10,915 --> 00:00:14,570
As we earlier have discussed,

4
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:20,036
we use batches to train LSTMs.

5
00:00:20,036 --> 00:00:26,710
But now, which batch-size to select?

6
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:28,932
So, what could it be?

7
00:00:28,932 --> 00:00:31,950
It could be one, or probably six,

8
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:36,345
or 12, or 64, or 100.

9
00:00:36,345 --> 00:00:38,540
What is the optimum?

10
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:42,635
This is a very important decision because

11
00:00:42,635 --> 00:00:49,405
as you will see and especially in the programming assignments,

12
00:00:49,405 --> 00:00:58,128
you are going to see how strongly it impacts the prediction accuracy.

13
00:00:58,128 --> 00:01:07,103
Now, just imagine you don't know nothing about this world,

14
00:01:07,103 --> 00:01:11,330
you would like to learn what the bird is.

15
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:15,460
So, how to distinguish a bird from

16
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:21,370
all other animals or all other things which you are seeing around you.

17
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:30,225
And you learned that as a child like you have never seen a bird.

18
00:01:30,225 --> 00:01:38,215
So now, you are shown images of birds,

19
00:01:38,215 --> 00:01:43,280
and there are two modes how can you learn.

20
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,590
For example, this is just example, just a game.

21
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:56,515
And the first mode you will be presented one image at the time.

22
00:01:56,515 --> 00:01:58,560
So you see one image,

23
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,545
one bird image, then you make your notes,

24
00:02:02,545 --> 00:02:09,015
you identify special bird qualities,

25
00:02:09,015 --> 00:02:13,243
and this is what this meaning setting weights.

26
00:02:13,243 --> 00:02:18,305
So, you are actually weighting some properties as

27
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:24,895
very important for a bird like intrinsic properties,

28
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:28,495
or you'll say, "Okay.

29
00:02:28,495 --> 00:02:31,675
This is property common for other things,

30
00:02:31,675 --> 00:02:34,079
so it's not a bird special."

31
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:37,265
So, you'll see one image of a bird,

32
00:02:37,265 --> 00:02:40,265
make your notes, then you see another image,

33
00:02:40,265 --> 00:02:43,080
and another image, and another image.

34
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,680
Another mode would be,

35
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:50,010
you will be presented several images at a time.

36
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:55,705
Let's say, five, not too much, maybe 10.

37
00:02:55,705 --> 00:02:59,800
And then you see all those 10 images,

38
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:07,605
and you are going immediately recognize some similarities between those creatures.

39
00:03:07,605 --> 00:03:11,240
You're going to see that they have feathers,

40
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,743
and so on, and so on at one time.

41
00:03:14,743 --> 00:03:20,625
So, you have all those samples and you can compare,

42
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:23,370
and you can learn much faster,

43
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,237
and much more efficient.

44
00:03:26,237 --> 00:03:29,226
This is for humans.

45
00:03:29,226 --> 00:03:36,070
And as by our experience,

46
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:43,660
is this similar to machines especially for such networks as LSTMs,

47
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:48,210
also for CNN's for convolutional neural networks.

48
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:56,240
It is important to provide a batch-size which

49
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:05,600
is for the machine optimal to learn the underlying pattern.

50
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,600
And as by our experience,

51
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:18,468
a batch-size is around 60 to 80 are in most cases optimal.

52
00:04:18,468 --> 00:04:24,774
And therefore, we're going to select a batch-size of 64.

53
00:04:24,774 --> 00:04:28,355
It doesn't have to be 64 or 62,

54
00:04:28,355 --> 00:04:34,845
just common to select such numbers like 32,

55
00:04:34,845 --> 00:04:39,760
and so on divided by eight.

56
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:46,230
It's not imperative but, okay.

57
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:54,085
So, we're going to select the batch of size 64.

58
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:59,090
And later on, we will see in programming assignments what is going

59
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:04,230
to happen if you use batch of size six, for example.

60
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:07,310
This is interesting.

61
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,590
First of all,

62
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:13,670
you will see that the performance if you train your neural network,

63
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:16,824
you will see it will take much more time.

64
00:05:16,824 --> 00:05:23,705
But is it impacting the performance positively or negatively?

65
00:05:23,705 --> 00:05:26,680
You are going to figure out in your programming assignments.

66
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,340
So, stay tuned, until the next time. Bye bye.
