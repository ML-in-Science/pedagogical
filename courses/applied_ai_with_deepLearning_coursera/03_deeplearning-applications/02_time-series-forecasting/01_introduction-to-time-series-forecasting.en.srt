00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,740
I'm very excited to welcome
you to our training session on

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:09,690
Sequence Prediction with Keras and LSTM.

3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:12,440
First of all, we need, of course, data.

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,971
And I have decided that we can go to FRED,

5
00:00:17,971 --> 00:00:22,160
the Federal Reserve Bank on St. Louis.

6
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:30,237
And download here Crude Oil Prices for

7
00:00:30,237 --> 00:00:34,090
oil Brent in Europe.

8
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:39,583
This data is measured since 1987,

9
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:43,540
and we can download the entire data set,

10
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,040
what I have already done.

11
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,290
We can have a first look at this data.

12
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:55,364
We see that it has several peaks,

13
00:00:55,364 --> 00:00:59,301
one was in September 1990.

14
00:00:59,301 --> 00:01:04,197
And the biggest one in June 2008,

15
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:08,787
then it went down, then it went up,

16
00:01:08,787 --> 00:01:13,100
and so on, and so on, and so on.

17
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:19,633
This data, we can download
by clicking on this button,

18
00:01:19,633 --> 00:01:26,729
and then we can import it into
our development environment.

19
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:34,620
And here, we have to upload the data
into the Cloud Object Storage.

20
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:41,610
We are using
Cloud Object Storage to ensure

21
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:46,650
that the data is located
in merged environment.

22
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:52,620
As you'll see,
I have already uploaded the data.

23
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,770
This is very simple.

24
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:56,400
You'll click on browse here.

25
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:01,980
And it will be uploaded, and
then you click on Insert to Code.

26
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:07,350
It will insert some lines of code and
in the end, if you execute this code,

27
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:13,060
you are getting the data
as a Pandas DataFrame.

28
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:17,115
You see it has two columns,

29
00:02:17,115 --> 00:02:20,825
it has 7,993 rows.

30
00:02:20,825 --> 00:02:24,196
And here,
I have to mention the data source,

31
00:02:24,196 --> 00:02:30,080
that the data is coming from
US Energy Information Administration.

32
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:36,174
In the first step, we have to do
some minor data pre-processing.

33
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:44,997
And this is because the data
contains some innate rules.

34
00:02:44,997 --> 00:02:50,201
And in the CC file,
every time where the innate

35
00:02:50,201 --> 00:02:55,005
is in the data,
they have put a point in it,

36
00:02:55,005 --> 00:02:59,289
so we have to remove all those points.

37
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:06,050
What we can do now, and we can see,
if you bring the shape,

38
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:12,810
we can see that around
200 rows were removed.

39
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:19,390
First, what we can do, we can print out,
we can visualize our data.

40
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:26,652
And this is done by calling plot function.

41
00:03:28,802 --> 00:03:35,628
And here, we can see similar
representation of the data,

42
00:03:35,628 --> 00:03:41,198
as we've already seen on
the home page of FRED,

43
00:03:41,198 --> 00:03:48,580
a Federal Reserve Bank,
all those peaks and so on, and so on.

44
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:57,229
And yes, with this we
are finishing the data upload part.

45
00:03:57,229 --> 00:04:04,263
And we are looking forward to
see you in the next section.

46
00:04:04,263 --> 00:04:10,617
Stay tuned, and
enjoy sequence prediction, bye-bye.
